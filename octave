{=(r4):**Go DJ, that's my DJ:**\nHow to make/assign DJ role? 
From your server menu, make a role and name it DJ. It doesn't matter where this role sits on your server's hiearchy list, just make sure it's the only role named as such. Once that's done, assign this role to any users (yourself included) to allow Octave to recognize the holder of the new role as the DJ for the sessions in play. This role allows users to skip, jump, and otherwise override the queue of other user request.
â€” 
**A couple of other useful settings might include:**\n`_settings djrole rolename`:\nSet any role to the DJ role\n\n`_settings requiredj disable`:\nAllows playback management commands to be used by users without the DJ role.\n\n`_settings djonly enable`:\nDisables commands entirely for any users __without__ the DJ role.\n\n`_settings djrolesadd rolename`:\nAdds extra DJ roles.\n\n`_settings djroleslist`:\nLists all of the extra DJ roles you've set.\n\n`_settings djrolesremove rolename`:\nRemoves extra DJ roles.}
{=(r5):**Managing Access and Settings:**\nOctave comes stocked with ability to make user access limitations within your server as granular as you can dream. 
Follow along the bot prompts to change these settings. 
For example:\nTo make the bot ignore commands in a channel, do `_ignore channel [channel]`\nYou can adjust command OR category usability by user, role, and/or channel. However, if you have `Administrator` or `Manage Server` it will still respond to you. You can check your ignored channels / users / roles using `_ignore list`}
{=(r6):You can pass these key words `{join(`, `):{opt}}` to view those sections specifically}
{=(r-1): {r1}\n
**Playing Music:** `_play,` `_youtube`, `_soundcloud` to get the music going..
You can also run any of these for general queue adding/removal
`_pause` â€¢ Pause or resume the music player.

4. [Check that you have the bot turned up](https://i.imgur.com/hAQqS33.png)
5. Check that the bot is not paused. (You should be able to tell based on whether there's a green ring around the bot). You can resume the bot with `_play`.
6. Check that the bot is playing a track. (You can check this now `_np`).
7. Check that the bot's player volume is not turned down (`_volume`). *This is a patreon perk, if you are a patron, you can use the volume command*

{=(r9):**Are we allowed to use custom playlists as a radio station, if so how can we do it?**\nYes, you can use custom playlists as a radio station. To play it as a radio station, do `_radio custom <your playlist name>`.\n\n**Can we still play the preset radio stations that were already on the bot?**\nYes, you can still play the preset radio stations `_radio discordfm <radio station name>`.\n\n**How can I stop the radio station?**\n`_radio stop`}
{=(r10):**Why did volume/bassboost/filters stop working for me?**\nThis is recently changed to be a patreon perk which you can find as a perk on our patreon [here by clicking this blue link](https://www.patreon.com/octavebot?join). We know this sucks, and a lot of you added Octave for the sake of free volume, but unfortunately we can't both lose our growth AND be in the negatives for monthly income. Hopefully it won't always be this way, once things get more stable. But with the cost of performance for everything being free, we don't have the money to keep expanding servers for free volume to keep existing.}
{=(r11):**Have a suggestion for the bot?**\nPlease make sure that your idea is **NOT** on the bot (see ``_help`` for list of commands, if its not on the main bot, then make sure it isn't on Octave Canary as well, see ``-help`` for list of commands), nor in <#675349770016915469>, nor on the [Trello (by clicking this blue text)](https://trello.com/b/gWGJVv3O/octave). If its not on any of these mentioned, then run ``-suggest <your idea here>`` in <#224378250682564608>.}
