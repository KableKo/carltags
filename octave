{=(r4):**Go DJ, that's my DJ:**\nHow to make/assign DJ role? 
From your server menu, make a role and name it DJ. It doesn't matter where this role sits on your server's hiearchy list, just make sure it's the only role named as such. Once that's done, assign this role to any users (yourself included) to allow Octave to recognize the holder of the new role as the DJ for the sessions in play. This role allows users to skip, jump, and otherwise override the queue of other user request.
— 
**A couple of other useful settings might include:**\n`_settings djrole rolename`:\nSet any role to the DJ role\n\n`_settings requiredj disable`:\nAllows playback management commands to be used by users without the DJ role.\n\n`_settings djonly enable`:\nDisables commands entirely for any users __without__ the DJ role.\n\n`_settings djrolesadd rolename`:\nAdds extra DJ roles.\n\n`_settings djroleslist`:\nLists all of the extra DJ roles you've set.\n\n`_settings djrolesremove rolename`:\nRemoves extra DJ roles.}
{=(r5):**Managing Access and Settings:**\nOctave comes stocked with ability to make user access limitations within your server as granular as you can dream. 
Follow along the bot prompts to change these settings. 
For example:\nTo make the bot ignore commands in a channel, do `_ignore channel [channel]`\nYou can adjust command OR category usability by user, role, and/or channel. However, if you have `Administrator` or `Manage Server` it will still respond to you. You can check your ignored channels / users / roles using `_ignore list`}
{=(r6):You can pass these key words `{join(`, `):{opt}}` to view those sections specifically}
{=(r-1): {r1}\n
**Playing Music:** `_play,` `_youtube`, `_soundcloud` to get the music going..
You can also run any of these for general queue adding/removal
`_pause` • Pause or resume the music player.
`_stop` • Stop and clear the music player...[`-o play` for more]\n

{=(r9):**How to make playlists on Octave?**\n\n`_playlists create <playlist name>`\nThis creates a new custom playlist to the bot.\n\n`_playlists delete <playlist name>`\nThis deletes one of your custom playlist from the bot. You MUST type the full name of the playlist or it will not delete the playlist.\n\n`_playlists edit <playlist name>`\nThis edits your custom playlist. You can also use a fuzzy search instead of typing the full name of the playlist. For example, if the playlist is named `Thumbs Up - Google Play Music`, you can do `_playlists edit Google` and it will show up. When you run the command, type `help` to see the full list of commands on how to move songs, remove songs, etc from the playlist.\n\n`_playlists import <link>`\nThis imports a playlist from YouTube/SoundCloud/Spotify etc.\n\n`_playlists list`\nThis lists all of your custom playlists on the bot.\n\n`_playlists load <playlist name>`\nThis loads a custom playlist for playing. You can also use a fuzzy search instead of typing the full name of the playlist. For example, if the playlist is named `Thumbs Up - Google Play Music`, you can do `_playlists load Google` and it will load the playlist.\n\n`_add <playlist name> <query>`\nThis Searches for and adds a track to a playlist.\n\n`_savequeue <playlist name>`\nSaves the entire queue to a custom playlist.\n\n`_saveto <playlist name>`\nSaves the current track to a custom playlist.}

To play it as a radio station, do `_radio custom <your playlist name>`.\n\n**Can we still play the preset radio stations that were already on the bot?**\nYes, you can still play the preset radio stations `_radio discordfm <radio station name>`.\n\n**How can I stop the radio station?**\n`_radio stop`}
{=(r11):**Why did volume/bassboost/filters stop working for me?**\nThis is recently changed to be a patreon perk which you can find as a perk on our patreon [here by clicking this blue link](https://www.patreon.com/octavebot?join). We know this sucks, and a lot of you added Octave for the sake of free volume, but unfortunately we can't both lose our growth AND be in the negatives for monthly income. Hopefully it won't always be this way, once things get more stable. But with the cost of performance for everything being free, we don't have the money to keep expanding servers for free volume to keep existing.}
{=(r12):**Have a suggestion for the bot?**\nPlease make sure that your idea is **NOT** on the bot (see ``_help`` for list of commands, if its not on the main bot, then make sure it isn't on Octave Canary as well, see ``-help`` for list of commands), nor in <#675349770016915469>, nor on the [Trello (by clicking this blue text)](https://trello.com/b/gWGJVv3O/octave). If its not on any of these mentioned, then run ``-suggest <your idea here>`` in <#224378250682564608>.}
{=(r13):**Claiming Octave Perks**\nWe're currently experiencing issues with Patreon. If you've pledged but are unable to link your account with the bot, you can DM **devoxin#8834** for your perks. If you've not received a donor role within the server, you may need to provide proof-of-pledge.}
